      "description": "I am a software developer with experience on both large and small development teams building projects with different scopes and timelines. I obtained an Associates degree in software development from Kirkwood Community College, along with certificates in Java and .Net Programming. I rose as far as effort could take me in my position as an auditor. As a supervisor I led small teams and acted as the point of contact for clients. When my scrum team asked me to take over I became the leader of our scrum meetings. I facilitated interaction between scrum teams with a goal of efficient communication and effective results. When I encounter a complex problem I take time to think through a path that will reach the necessary conclusion.",
